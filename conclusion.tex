Machine learning based early warning signals. 

Possible connection between machine-learning based and analytical theory based early warning signals? i.e. using theory to inform ML design. 


Mention papers where critical transitions occur with no lead warning



As pressures exerted by modern day anthropogenic practices on the Earth grow in magnitude and complexity, threatening physical, ecological, and social systems on all scales with unprecedented forms of change, this goal becomes even more pressing.
