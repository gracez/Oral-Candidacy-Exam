\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Summarize and reiterate, etc.

%Mention paper with the network model (I think?) where critical transition occurs with no lead warning.

%Mention flickering and/or skewness?

Pressures exerted by modern day anthropogenic practices on the Earth grow in magnitude and complexity, threatening physical, ecological, and social systems on all scales with unprecedented forms of change. Therefore, achieving a deeper understanding of how systems behave near critical transitions and how to identify early warning signs of impending critical transitions becomes an increasingly pressing goal.
