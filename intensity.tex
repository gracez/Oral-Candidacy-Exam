\subsection{Intensity of Attraction}

The definitions of asymptotic resilience and reactivity both require linearizing at a point attractor. In contrast, intensity of attraction, introduced by Katherine Meyer in her PhD thesis \cite{meyerMetricPropertiesAttractors2019}, measures resilience for any attractor, and captures metric information across its entire basin of attraction rather than replacing the nonlinear dynamics with a local approximation.
