# Oral Candidacy Exam

This is a repository for my **PhD Candidacy Exam paper**, titled "Transient Dynamical Indicators of Critical Transitions: Toward an Intensity-Based Understanding." The paper can be viewed at `main.pdf`. 

There is an accompanying [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qmrwkfHIxTyP_O1UuHejmaE_B-9Rr1Eq/view?usp=sharing), and this slideshow is built with an eye toward being as accessible as possible for a general audience, since my exam committee is not entirely composed of mathematicians -- in particular, one committee member is a wildlife veterinarian. 

I think maybe the first portion of the slides succeeds in this goal at least.

If you are wondering why I have a veterinarian on my committee, it's because I am motivated deep down by understanding modern tipping points in nature, including in infectious disease ecology.

The LaTeX source for the paper is contained in the `tex` folder.
