\section{Resilience Quantification}
\label{sec:resilience}

The concept of resilience differs between authors and disciplines, and an abundance of quantification approaches have been proposed. Loosely, resilience refers to the capacity for a system to retain its overall qualitative structure in the face of disturbances. 
%
In this section, we define asymptotic resilience, reactivity, and intensity of attraction. 
%
For some other definitions of resilience that we do not cover, see \cite{meyerMathematicalReviewResilience2016}.



Let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be open, and suppose that $f : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$. Consider a system of ordinary differential equations 

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:ode}
	x' = f(x)
\end{equation}

and let $\varphi: \mathbb{R} \times U \to U$ be the associated local flow, so that $\varphi(t,x_0) = x(t)$ solves the ODE with initial condition $x(0) = x_0$.
